# React SPA Role Challenge

This is a React Single Page Application (SPA) that implements a role challenge system, featuring a login page, a dashboard page, and an admin dashboard page.

## Folder Structure

The application is organized into the `spa` folder.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pprometheus/spa
cd spa
```

2. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

### Login Page

The SPA includes a login page that allows two types of users: normal users and admins. Normal users have access to the dashboard page, while admins can access both the admin dashboard and the normal dashboard.

### Dashboard Page

The dashboard page provides functionality to sort 12 images by category. Users can assign, reassign, or delete labels on an image. They can also view images filtered by labels.

### Admin Dashboard Page

The admin dashboard allows admins to create new labels, which are used to categorize the images on the main dashboard page.
